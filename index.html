    My research focuses on developing "curious" AI agents that can autonomously discover and learn a diversity of structures and skills in their environments.
    In particular, I am interested in transposing these computational models into AI-driven "discovery assistants" that could assist scientists in mapping and navigating
    the space of possible outcomes of complex self-organizing systems, and in accelerating scientific discovery in these systems.

    I recently defended my Ph.D. in Machine Learning under the supervision of <a href="http://pyoudeyer.com/">Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</a> and <a href="https://clement-moulin-frier.github.io/">Clément Moulin-Frier</a> at the <a href="https://flowers.inria.fr/">FLOWERS</a> team at Inria, Bordeaux; and in collaboration with the <a href="https://poietis.com/">Poietis</a> biotech company. Last year, I also went on a 4-month visit to Dr. <a href="https://drmichaellevin.org/people/">Michael Levin</a> and his team at the <a href="https://drmichaellevin.org/">Levin Lab</a> at Tufts University.

    Previously, I have been at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College of London</a> where I completed my
    Master of Science (MSc) in computer vision and at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/">Télécom Paristech</a>
    where I did my Master of Engineering (MEng).
    I also spent a year as an AI research intern at <a href="https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/">Siemens
    Healthineers</a>, Princeton N.J., working on deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms for healthcare.
