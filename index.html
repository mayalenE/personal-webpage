    I'm interested in many things related to <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>AI for Science</b>, and <b>Open-Endedness</b>.<br>
    My research has focused on developing open-ended AI agents that unsupervisedly learn to represent and set their own goals in complex dynamical systems,
    with the aim to accelerate scientific discovery by assisting humans' exploration of the structures that can self-organize in these systems.

    I recently defended my Ph.D. in Machine Learning under the supervision of <a href="http://pyoudeyer.com/">Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</a> and <a href="https://clement-moulin-frier.github.io/">Clément Moulin-Frier</a> at the <a href="https://flowers.inria.fr/">FLOWERS</a> team at Inria, Bordeaux; and in collaboration with the <a href="https://poietis.com/">Poietis</a> biotech company. Last year, I also went on a 4-month visit to Dr. <a href="https://drmichaellevin.org/people/">Michael Levin</a> and his team at the <a href="https://drmichaellevin.org/">Levin Lab</a> at Tufts University.

    Previously, I have been at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College of London</a> where I completed my
    Master of Science (MSc) in computer vision and at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/">Télécom Paristech</a>
    where I did my Master of Engineering (MEng).
    I also spent a year as an AI research intern at <a href="https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/">Siemens
    Healthineers</a>, Princeton N.J., working on deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms for healthcare. 
    My extended CV can be found <a href="assets/pdf/Resume_Mayalen_Etcheverry.pdf">here</a>.
